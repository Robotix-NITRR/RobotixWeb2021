        <h2 class="text-info"><strong>The Ultimate Robotics Hackathon ( 29 Feb - 1 Mar )</strong></h2>
        <p class="text-white h4">A Robothon is a Robotics Hackathon organized by <b>Robotix Club NIT Raipur</b>, for the
          sole purpose of bringing robotics enthusiasts together and discussing
          real life problems and their solution by creative ideas within a limited time frame by employing and enhancing
          technical skills that participants already have.
          It is all about robotics, automation and education.<br>
          The Robothon would be a <b>32 hour long challenge</b> where a number of problem statements would be launched
          prior to the event. The Problem statements would range from IOT projects to defense related problems.
          A team is allowed to select a problem of their choice and come up with a viable solution.<br>
          A team would consist of <b>6 students (irrespective of their branches)</b>, having the zeal and enthusiasm to
          build a robot capable of solving real-life problems.<br>
          The Robothon would be attended by students from top colleges across INDIA. Out of which we wish to accommodate
          70% students from NIT Raipur itself and for the other 30% seats we plan to have participation from various
          IITs.<br>

        <p class="text-white h4">It is a two day event consisting of two rounds.</p>
        <p class="text-white h4">First round is the abstract submission where pseudo problem statements which will be
          based on local challenges will be given.
          Submit your abstract and 18 most innovative solutions will be selected for second round and then create your
          bot within 24 hours.
          Use your basics of Robotics and innovate new things. Come in group of 5 to effectively use your brain as it is
          said five fingers when united makes a punch </p>
