            <p class="text-white mb-3">Robofest provides an opportunity for the students of the institute to practically
              apply their knowledge in
              Robotics by use of their problem solving ability. By giving the students an opportunity to interact with
              the field specialists we hope to boost each students’ entrepreneurial spirit.
              The Fest incorporates all this under one roof and provides the participants with a firsthand experience
              with Robotics.
              <br>
              Robofest will be organized in collaboration with team TED-X NIT Raipur, to encourage the spirit of
              collaboration between students.
              Collaboration is extremely helpful as it saves ample of time and resources of organizing event as
              everything is a joint effort.
              <br>
              Mentorship and Guidance will also be provided to the participants by industry experts to accelerate their
              potential.
              This will give each student a great opportunity to learn about the various future scopes in Robotics and
              prepare them for it.
